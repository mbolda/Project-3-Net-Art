	<h1> Wow! You Found the Hidden Page!</h1>
	<h2> Did You Know The Number 39 Is Associated With Miku?</h2>
	<h3> That's Why This Page Was Hidden On The 39th Miku On The Last Page</h3>

	<p1>The reason lies in the pronunciation of the Japanese language. 39 is simply just a pun and it was soon picked up and used by Crypton Future Media, Inc., the creators of Hatsune Miku.
<br/>
In Japanese, words can be made into numbers as a sort of shortcut. Numbers 1–10 have a kanji to them with a few different ways to read each of them. The number 3 is pronounced “Mi (み)” and 9 is pronounced “ku (く)” so 39 is pronounced “Miku”. That’s the main reason why it’s being used.
<br/>
Also, there’s an alternate pronunciation where 3 is pronounced as “San (さん)” and 9 as “Kyuu (きゅう)” and, when combined, it says “Sankyuu” which is similar to “Thank you” in English. That’s another reason why it’s being used.</p1>
